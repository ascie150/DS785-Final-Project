# DS785-Final-Project

This project explored using completely unsupervised and semi supervised machine learning algorithms to predict anomalies within clickstream variables. 
I found the https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/outlier_detection.html employed the majority of methods after researching past literature for similar problems.

I teste the methods in the DS 785 Notebook 10-26-24.ipynb notebook on a sample test set. When I attempted to scale the sample size up to the population size, I found the only the Isolation Forest Algorithm to be performant in a reasonable amount of time with the resources I had available in my AWS Workspace.
