# DS785-Final-Project

This project explored using completely unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to predict anomalies within clickstream variables. 

The final output document is labeled as "Final Draft - Alan Scieszinski 12-8-24.docx". This project used the below notebooks. 

Notebooks:
I tested the methods in the "DS 785 Notebook 10-26-24.ipynb" notebook on a sample test set. 
The isolation forest production runs used for the project are found in the "DS 785 Iso Runs 11-14-24.ipynb" notebook.
